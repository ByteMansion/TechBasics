# Manuals of Tools for SE
## Why this manual booklet?
As  a software engineer(SE), many useful tools are important to improve efficiency and communication. More time should be used to change this world(fix bugs caused by himself actually -.-|).

I write these simplified docs about very useful tools down to facilitate those freshmen and myself in case I forget some points. 

Those docs are not complete absolutely, but can play an important role when you have to use one tool in an hour. I list basic knowledge of each tool and some simple cases. 

## Makefile manual
[GNU Make Manual](./Simplified_GNU_Make_Manual.md)

This manual is about `GNU make` tools. Makefile is important for those engineers working on a large programes to compile source files and generate executables.

## Markdown manual
[Markdown Manual](./Simplified_Markdown_Manual.md)

This manual is about `Markdown` tools. Markdown is, to some extent, the most important tools for a software engineer. As we all know, none of tools can be better than `markdown` to display code in a doc in an elegent way.

## LaTex manual
[LaTex Manual](./Latex_Manual.md)

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. 

But writing down a manual of LaTex that covers all aspects of its function is not my aim absolutely. This doc is only for those who typeset mathematical formats frequently. Most `markdown` apps support `LaTex` and combining those two tools is a beginning of way leading to elegance and perfection.
