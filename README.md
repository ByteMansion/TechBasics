# Manuals of Tools for SE
## Why this manual booklet?
As  a software engineer(SE), many useful tools are important to improve efficiency. 

I write down these simplified docs about the powerful tools as my handbooks in case I forget some points. 

Those docs are not complete, but can play an important role when you want to familiarize an absulute new tool quickly. I document basic tips of each tool and show some simple cases. 

## Makefile manual
[GNU Make Manual](./Simplified_GNU_Make_Manual.md)

This manual is about `GNU make` tools. Makefile is important for those engineers working on a large program to compile source files and generate executables.

## CMake manual
[Cmake](./CMake_Introduction.md)

[CMake](https://cmake.org) is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software. CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in compiler environment of your choice.

CMake Command is simple compared to Makefile and can be applied into development process quickly.

This manual is about CMake Commands used to write scripts to build source files.

## Markdown manual
[Markdown Manual](./Simplified_Markdown_Manual.md)

This manual is about `Markdown` tools. Markdown is, to some extent, the most important tools for a software engineer. 
As we all know, none of tools can be better than `markdown` to display code and formula in an elegent way.

## LaTex manual
[LaTex Manual](./Latex_Manual.md)

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. 

But writing down a manual of LaTex that covers all aspects of its functions and syntax is not my aim. This doc is only for those who typeset mathematical formulas frequently. Most `markdown` apps support `LaTex` and using these two tools in a doc is a beginning leading to elegance.

## Tricks
### Add git branch name into bash prompt
[add git branch name into bash prompt](./trick/AddGitBranchToPrompt.md)

This manual is about how to add git branch name into bash prompt, which is important and useful for software engineers working on large program.

## !Note
If you notice that LaTex syntax cannot display well on some web page, there are 2 ways to solve it.

1. Please git clone this repo and review the page in your local machine with a Latex-support app, such as [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with a markdown extention. All manuals are wrote in vscode and display absolutely well.
2. If you are using Google Chrome web browser, you can download [Tex All The Things](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tex-all-the-things/cbimabofgmfdkicghcadidpemeenbffn) extension, which can render LaTex well except for certain Greek letters.

Sometimes, I adjust several docs for a well symbol or formula rendering, which may lead to incompatibility with local LaTex app.

If anything is wrong or you have a better solution to this possible problem, please feel free to let me know.
