# LaTex manual
[LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/) is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features 
designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard 
for the communication and publication of scientific documents$^{[1]}$.

## Why this manual?
I wrote this manual isn't aimed at providing a complete LaTex syntax instruction, instead of giving a 
list of LaTex mathematical symbols that are commonly used for a software engineer, especially involving 
some algorithms.
I have wrote a manual of [markdown syntax](./Simplified_Markdown_Manual.md), and it gives a brief introduction 
of how to insert LaTex formulas into markdown file.

If not support Latex, it is difficult or disgusting to write a formula in markdown docs. LaTex is the most concise 
and elegant way to display a math formula.

## Latex mathematical symbols
